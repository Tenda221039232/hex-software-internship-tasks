# 🧪 Task 1: Data Exploration – Hex Software Internship

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the work done for Task 1 of my internship at **Hex Software**, focused on **data exploration**. The goal was to understand the structure, patterns, and potential issues in a dataset related to student performance in mathematics.

## 📂 Files Included
- `task_1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the data exploration process
- `Math-Students.csv`: Dataset used for analysis

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 What I Did
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Checked for missing values and data types
- Analyzed distributions and relationships between variables
- Visualized trends and correlations using charts and plots
- Documented observations and initial insights

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Found that [insert interesting observation here, e.g., "study time correlates positively with exam scores"]
- Identified missing or inconsistent data in [mention column if any]
- Detected outliers in [mention feature]

## 🚀 Next Steps
This exploration sets the stage for further steps like:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model building or dashboard creation (in later tasks)

## 📎 Notes
The dataset is anonymized and used for learning purposes only.
